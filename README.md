# Fedora Config Script

This program targets mainly new Linux users. When you first install your Linux distribution, you then also need to configure it. The configuration can include adding repositories, changing some config files, etc. That can be really difficult for absolute beginner.

This script will guide you through the whole configuration process on Fedora to make the system convenient for you. Every change is optional to make the configuration suit everyone.

> **⚠️ Warning:** This project is still under development! We DON'T recommend to run the script on a working machine until all the bugs are fixed and first version is released. Otherwise it can break your system.

You can run the script with this one single command:

```sh
wget -qO /tmp/fedoraconfigscript.sh https://gitlab.com/pervoj/fedoraconfig/-/raw/main/fedoraconfig.sh && bash /tmp/fedoraconfigscript.sh
```
